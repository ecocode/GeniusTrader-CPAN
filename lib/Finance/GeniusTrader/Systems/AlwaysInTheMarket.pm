=head1 AlwaysInTheMarket Trading System

=head2 Overview

This system will generate every time it is called a long and a short signal.

=head2 Examples

To set up a Buy And Hold strategy :
SY:AlwaysInTheMarket|CS:NeverClose|TF:LongOnly|TF:OneTrade

To set up a Short And Hold strategy :
SY:AlwaysInTheMarket|CS:NeverClose|TF:ShortOnly|TF:OneTrade

=head2 Note

In which way is a BuyAndHold or a ShortAndHold system usefull ?

The main purpose is to run the system on a list of securities, in order to
get the portfolio performance. Let's try to catch indices performance with
just a few stocks and beat the market only with money-management ! Welcome
to the world of portfolio selection and portfolio optimization.
