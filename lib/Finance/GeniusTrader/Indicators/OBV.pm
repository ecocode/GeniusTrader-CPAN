=head2 Overview

On Balance Volume (OBV) is a momentum indicator that relates volume price change.

On Balance Volume was developed by Joe Granville and originally presented in his book New Strategy of Daily Stock Market Timing for Maximum Profits.

=head2 Calculation

On Balance Volume is calculated by adding the day's volume to a cumulative total when the security's price closes up, and subtracting the day's volume when the security's price closes down.

If today's close is greater than yesterday's close then :
OBV = Yesterday's OBV + Today's Volume

If today's close is less than yesterday's close then :
OBV = Yesterday's OBV - Today's Volume

If today's close is equal to yesterday's close then :
OBV = Yesterday's OBV
