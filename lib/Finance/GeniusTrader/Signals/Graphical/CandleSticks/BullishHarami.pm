=head2 Overview

The Bullish Harami signifies a decrease of momentum. It occurs when a
small bullish (empty) line occurs after a large bearish (filled)
line in such a way that close of the bullish line is above the open
of the bearish line and the open of the bullish line is lower than the
close of the bearish line.

The Bullish Harami is a mirror image of the Bearish Engulfing Line.

=head2 Construction

If yesterday closed higher, a Bullish Harami will form when today's open
is above yesterday's close and today's close is above yesterday's open.

this pattern suggests a trend change.
